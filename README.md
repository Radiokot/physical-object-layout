# PhysicalObjectLayout

[![Latest release](https://jitpack.io/v/radiokot/physical-object-layout.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#radiokot/physical-object-layout)

An Android layout that properly scales its content in order to display physical objects such as credit cards, passports, etc.

[Download Sample App APK](https://github.com/Radiokot/physical-object-layout/releases/download/1.0.0/physical-object-layout-sample.apk)

## Dependency
Ensure that you have JitPack repo added to your project `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
Add the library to your app `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.radiokot:physical-object-layout:1.0.1'
}
```
## What problem does it solve?

If you have ever tried to design and display a representation of physical world object, i.e. a credit card, 
in your Android app I‚Äôm pretty sure you have noticed, that the way it appears on the screen is‚Ä¶ different ü§î 

In Android we make fluid layouts. We specify sizes and margins in device-related units, set gravity for views 
and constraining them to each other to avoid overlaps. As a result, our layout looks good on different screens. 

But when it comes to displaying a physical object, things get messy:

![The problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5675681/95361727-c91b5500-08d5-11eb-9fcc-0f8b7f713a49.png)

Unlike our regular layouts, 
physical objects are not fluid, they must be proportionally scaled instead. 
When you figure this out you also realize, that such scaling of a layout is not an ordinary thing to do in Android. 
- You can‚Äôt use post-scaling because it looks blurry and requires drawing outside of the view frame
- You can‚Äôt just make this view a vector drawable because some of the elements have variable content
- Creating many-many dimens for every screen width is just crazy

## PhysicalObjectLayout comes to the rescue!

All you need to do is:
1. Create your layout with all sizes and margins fixed and set in `px`. 
Without any tricky layouts, without `dimens`, literally a copy of what the designers sent to you
2. Put the view into the `PhysicalObjectLayout`
3. Enjoy your view properly scaled to fit the container width or height, just like if it was an image

## Layout attributes
`PhysicalObjectLayout` has a few attributes that controls scaling and appearance:

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `pol_scaleBy` | Specifies a dimension that children will be scaled to fit to | `width` |
| `pol_addChildrenInvisible` | If enabled the layout will set its children visibility to `View.INVISIBLE` on add. As soon as the scaling is not instant it is recommended to keep this attribute enabled in order to avoid unscaled child blink | `true` |
| `pol_makeChildrenVisibleAfterScale` | If enabled the layout will set its children visibility to `View.VISIBLE` once they are scaled. Recommended to use in a combination with the previous attribute  | `true` |

## Scaling custom views

`PhysicalObjectLayout` allows you to specify custom scaling strategies in order to scale custom views. 

You can implement your own `ViewScalingStrategy` and apply it programmatically using `addScalingStrategies`
or `addScalingStrategy` methods.

Examples of custom scaling strategies can be found in the library itself:
[CardViewScalingStrategy](physicalobjectlayout/src/main/java/ua/com/radiokot/physicalobjectlayout/scalingstrategy/CardViewScalingStrategy.kt),
[TextViewScalingStrategy](physicalobjectlayout/src/main/java/ua/com/radiokot/physicalobjectlayout/scalingstrategy/TextViewScalingStrategy.kt)
